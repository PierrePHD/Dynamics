	Abstract = {We extend a new approach to the non-isothermal case, for the resolution
	of isothermal viscoplastic problems. The computational method is
	well suited for non-linear mechanical behaviour, described by internal
	variables. This approach is in contrast with the classical step-by-step
	method, as it is an iterative procedure that takes the whole loading
	process in a single time interval into account. The main point is
	to introduce a formulation of the thermo-mechanical problem adapted
	to the strategy that we use; we gather all the non-linearities in
	the evolution laws in order to obtain the linear state laws by using
	a change of variables that also allows us to remove the temperature
	from the state laws, except from Hooke{\'s} elasticity
	law (in which the effects of temperature are smooth). This formulation,
	called the normal formulation, is of great interest as it is well
	suited to most of the classical computational techniques and is particularly
	appropriate for the \{LArge\} Time Increment (LATIN) method that
	we use. Several examples illustrate the possibilities and efficiency
	of this strategy. A good accuracy is obtained in a few iterations,
	even in the case of realistic loading histories, and only a few linear
	elastic-type global problems have to be solved. },

	Abstract = {Delamination is a phenomenon which involves complex degradations of layers and interlaminar connections. In order to take these degradations into account, a laminate is modelled as a stacking sequence of homogeneous layers and interlaminar interfaces. The aim of this article is to focus on the interface modelling and first identification. The interface is a three-dimensional medium the thickness of which is negligible compared to the in-plane dimensions. Therefore it can be modelled as a two-dimensional entity which ensures displacement and traction transfer from one ply to another. The interface depends on the angle between the fibre directions of two adjacent layers. In the first instance it is assumed to be elastic and damageable. The main interest of this model is that, using only a few intrinsic characteristics of the interface, it is possible to predict the tendency of a structure to delaminate. One of the main difficulties is to identify these characteristics. This approach allows a clear connection between fracture mechanics and damage mechanics. This modelling has been used for the predicting of delamination initiation and growth in the case of static loadings without buckling. },

	Abstract = {When subjected to low-velocity impacts, the high damage/sensitivity of carbon/epoxy laminated composites results in localised damage, mainly transverse cracks and delaminations. To be able to assess the critical nature of the induced damage, a thorough description of the damage mechanisms is of primary importance. The challenge here is the prediction of the initiation and the propagation of low-velocity impact-induced damage by the use of damage mechanics. Therefore, a mechanical and numerical model of the damage occurring in laminates, previously defined at Laboratoire de M{\'e}canique et de Technologie (LMT) is updated to this specific type of loading. Preliminary results show a good correlation with accurate experimental measures. },

	based on the large time increment method and on the possibility offered

	stress fields in order to solve a nonlinear time-dependent problem.
	This technique relies on a time and space decomposition of the solution.
	It has been extended to solve at a low cost, the inverse problem
	of identification, for various techniques. In particular, it has
	been adapted to the minimization of the gradient of the gap between
	test and simulation. In this first attempt, it is applied to the
	simple case of bending of an elastic--viscoplastic beam. The issue
	of the numerical efficiency of this type of strategy is studied.

	Abstract = {The motivation of the paper is to develop a method allowing us to make use, in the context of identification, of highly perturbed tests leading to non-reliable measurements. Such tests are not seldom especially when dealing with structural fracture in dynamics. We follow here the concept of the modified constitutive relation error (MCRE) [1] where error on the model and error on the experimental data are both introduced. A first paper was devoted to the extension of the MCRE method to transient elasticity [2]. This paper is devoted to the extension to nonlinear constitutive relations, in particular viscoplasticity and damage. The MCRE formulation in transient dynamics leads to the solving of a coupled direct and adjoint nonlinear problem, which implies dedicated methods, which is the core of this paper. This has led us to define a particular MCRE formulation well suited for numerical treatment and to develop an extension of the LATIN method [3] to ill-posed problems. Once the difficulties have been resolved and the formulation implemented in the one-dimensional case, the proposed identification strategy appears to be very robust with respect to perturbed measurements in the absence of a priori knowledge, even in the case of localization and rupture.},
